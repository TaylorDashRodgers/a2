# A2 - An Unexpected Journey
- The program creates my 512x512 window where the background is a random hero home from the class. On top of this background we draw our hero avatar made up of individual parts all put together to make one. Our avatar is able to move using WASD and also interacts with the mouse based on where the mouse is and travels to where it is clicked. Along with this if you press left shift and mouse click it will change the backgrounds with out having to go off the sides to wrap around and change the background.
- To run the program you just have to open the .cpp file and click run once running you can control the hero's movement by using WASD to move up, left, down, right. Along with this you can click where you want the hero to appear. If you go off the window you will wrap around. You can also press left shift when you click the mouse to change the background. To close the program you can hit ESC.
- I didn't really experience too much bugs. The only big one was trying to get my hero to hover up and down it would go way to high and go off the window.
- This assignment took me a solid like 20 hours, but it was a lot of me just wanting it to look
better, so I messed around with a lot of it until I was satisfied.
- The lab was 10.
- This assignment was definitely a 10 for how fun it was I really enjoyed it probably too much.
